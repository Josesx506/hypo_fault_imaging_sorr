1. Install the enironment with the `sh env_setup.sh` command from your mac/linux terminal not vscode terminal.
    - For some reason, vscode runs within a virtual environment that does not copy the modified *spherecluster* files correctly.
2. Clean up the environment with `sh env_clean.sh` if you encounter any issues during installation.
3. Launch the environment with `conda activate hypimg` and start a notebook or python script to begin using the files
